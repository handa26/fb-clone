# Facebook Clone NextJS

Build this FB clone using NextJS in order to enhance my understanding around NextJS and also TailwindCSS.
Created using NextJS, Tailwind, and Firebase.

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) to install all required dependecies.
```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

Create new environment variable, `.env.local` in root project, inside it:
```
FACEBOOK_CLIENT_ID=<Client Id>
FACEBOOK_CLIENT_SECRET=<Client Secret>
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```
You can get both Facebook client id & secret on [Facebook Developer](https://developers.facebook.com/).
Also, don't forget to change firebaseConfig in `firebase.js` with your own config.

After install all dependecies, start developing by typing this:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Coming soon!
